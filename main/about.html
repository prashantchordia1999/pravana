									<p>Do you throw great parties or meetings? Want to get paid doing it? Then you're ready for a job as an event coordinator. Event coordinators also known as event specialists, are in charge of every facet of meeting and events. This isn't just some wine and cheese affair with your buddies. Event coordinators plan everything from weddings to large expos and trade shows.
<br></p>
Event coordinators control an event from conception to clean up. They meet with clients to work out event details, plan with the client and their team, scout and book locations, food, entertainment, staff and cleanup. Event coordinators make sure the shrimp cocktail stays cold and the hired band stays hot. They create budgets and stick to them, as well as organize transportation, hire and wrangle keynote speakers or celebrities, hire A/V teams and equipment, and generally make sure the event runs smoothly, efficiently and handle any crisis that may come up.</p>
